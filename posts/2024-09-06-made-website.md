I am very happy reaching the main idea or the concept of why my Uncle introduced markdown in Github to me, realizing that this can help me create websites for myself and for other people and help improve our lives.
Yesterday we learned how to create a page in github and turning it to a website and today has also been a wonderful one, we learned how to edit the website we created yesterday and I am now learning the features that it supports and the ones it doesn't.
So we edited the date, the title and the author, initially my Uncle was the author but today we changed the author and I am now the author. I now know many features on markdown and how useful they are in creating websites, I know how to upload photos to my repository, I know how to create emojis and many more and all these are very helpful.
I'm looking forward to knowing more and more about websites and be able to create websites for people and companies to gain something and make life for my Mother and I a little easier and I would be able to take care of myself and my family including people who need help.
